Image::DeAnim

Tired of all those animated GIF images that cause your browser to
freak out and your machine to slow down?  Image::DeAnim, when used
with a proxy server, will stop GIF animation.

INSTALLATION

The regular

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install

should work.  "make test" should also work, except there isn't a test suite.

PROXY SERVICE

This module does not provide the proxy server, you'll need your own.
I personally use a derivitave of the proxy server available at

    http://language.perl.com/misc/abiprox/

This module probably isn't of much use without proxy service, but if
someone comes up with a new use, I'd be curious to hear about it.
